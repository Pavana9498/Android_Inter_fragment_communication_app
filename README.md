This project has two applications working together to help visitors in Chicago decide on points of interests in nationâ€™s capital by providing the specific information about each point of interest.
The first application broadcasts broadcasts two different intents(e.g: attractions and restaurants) based on the user selection in the application.
The second application receives the intents and checks if the sender owns a custom permission and only then responds by launching an activity showing the points of interests. Both the activities have two fragments. The first one displaying a scrollable list of points of interests and the second one showing the official website of the item highlighted in the first fragment using a browser stored on the device. The selection and the page displayed is kept during the configuration changes of the phone. This application also maintains an option menu allowing user to switch between his selections and an action bar displaying the name of the application.
